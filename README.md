# CodeGenLib
A library made for the sole purpose of code generation, for use in things such as for codegen in compilers.
This project is going to be used in a W.I.P project of mine for Java codegen with Nim.

This package is listed on Nimble and can be installed with `nimble install CodeGenLib`.

## Currently Supported
* Java
  * This is a small subset of Java.

## To-Do
- [ ] For the love of god please properly reorganise this so it's semi-sane.
- [ ] Look into using ropes rather than string manipulation? Unsure how it works.
- [ ] Implement enum/record/interface/abstract class support.
- [ ] Document the code properly and clearly.
